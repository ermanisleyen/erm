Note: experiments in the data and experiments subdirectories are presented in the order in which they were run, with 1 and 2 being the two exploratory experiments, and 3 and 4 the pre-registered ones. In the paper we group exploratory experimetns with their pre-registered extensions, such that Experiment 3 is presented as Experiment 2, and Experiment 3 is presented as Experiment 3.
